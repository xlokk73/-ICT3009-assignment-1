The flow of the process is shown via a flowchart in figures \ref{fig:flowchart1} and \ref{fig:flowchart2}.


\subsection{Structures}

The most fundamental part of the contract is a structure for loan requests, \textit{LoanRequest}. 
This can be seen in listing \ref{lst:LoanRequestStruct}. This structure contains the information required regarding the three persons included in the deal, i.e. the borrower, the guarantor and the loaner.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loan Request Structure}\label{lst:LoanRequestStruct}, basicstyle=\ttfamily, frame=single, language=Solidity]
struct LoanRequest{
	uint    creationDate;       
	
	address payable borrower;
	uint    amount;             // Amount to be borrowed
	uint    expiryTime;         // Max time (in seconds) the loan will be paid back
	uint    interestPaid;       // Amount (in wei) paid on loan payback
	
	address payable guarantor; 
	uint    guarantorInterest;  // Amount (in wei) taken from interest by the guarantor
	
	address payable loaner;     
	State   state;            
}
\end{lstlisting}

The last field of the loan request structure is an enumeration called \textit{State}, which can be seen in listing \ref{lst:StateEnum}. This enumeration contains the information about what state the loan request resides in. The states are explained in table \ref{tab:StateEnum}.


	
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loan Request Structure}\label{lst:StateEnum}, basicstyle=\ttfamily, frame=single, language=Solidity]
enum State {
	REQUESTED,
	PENDING,
	GUARANTEED,
	LOANED,
	PAID,
	TERMINATED
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
	\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\begin{tabular}{ |c| c| }
			\hline
			\textbf{State} & \textbf{Description} \\ 
			\hline
			REQUESTED    & The borrower submitted a request  \\  
			\hline
			PENDING         &The guarantor submitted a guarantee and is waiting for approval \\
			\hline
			GUARANTEED & The guarantee has been accepted by the borrower\\
			\hline
			LOANED          & The loaner has loaned the money\\
			\hline
			PAID                & The borrower paid the loaner back before the loan expired\\
			\hline
			TERMINATED   & The loan expired and the loaner took the guarantee\\
			\hline
	\end{tabular}}
	\label{tab:StateEnum}
\end{center}

These loan requests are all kept in a dynamic array, \textit{LoanRequests[]}. Elements are added to this array from the functions. However, elements are never removed. This allows the system to keep a log of all requests ever made.

\subsection{Functions}

Functions in the contract are split into four sections, these being: general purpose, borrower, guarantor and loaner functions.
\\
General purpose functions are mostly used to get information about the loan requests. This means that most of them include the \textit{view} keyword.
\\
Functions that act on a created loan request take the index as a parameter. Furthermore, the functions have the following flow: checks, followed by code that transfer balance, followed by updating the loan request states. The reason for this is explain in the section about security. 

\subsection{Testing and Error checking}
The functions that are to be executed by users of a specific role (borrower, guarantor or loaner) have checks at the start to ensure validity. These checks are done using the \textit{require} function so useful messages are outputted. 
\\
For example, referring to listing \ref{lst:GuaranteeSubmissionChecks} when submitting a guarantee the check done are: checking that the request is in state \textit{REQUESTED}; checking that the amount of balance given by the guarantor is more that the amount requested by the borrower; and finally, checking that the interest to be taken by the guarantor is less than the interest the borrower will provide.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loan Request Structure}\label{lst:GuaranteeSubmissionChecks}, basicstyle=\ttfamily, frame=single, language=Solidity]
require(loanRequests[index].state == State.REQUESTED,   "Loan in invalid state");   
require(msg.value >= loanRequests[index].amount,        "Insufficient balance given");
require(loanRequests[index].interestPaid > interest,    "Guarantor interest must be less than Borrower interest");
\end{lstlisting}

Testing the functions in task 1 was done manually via the Remix IDE. The functionality was tested to be working as should with the provided interface and that in the case of misuse, a useful error message was printed. The feature to use multiple account was also used.
\\
For example if a guarantor wanted to try and accept his own guarantee, the checks would not pass and the error message "Caller is not Borrower" would provided as shown in figure \ref{fig:error}.
